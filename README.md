# Calendar Demo

It's a simple demo of how to render calendar events within a day. Overlapping events should have even width and rendered next to each others. For example, if a day has more than 3 events and only two of them are overlapping at the same time, then the width should be 50%, otherwise 33.33% and so on â€” the more events are overlapping, the less width each event should have. For the sake of simplicity, only one day will be rendered.

The installation is very easy run the install command.

```bash

Next up we can run the dev server:

And your website will start up.

**Note - make sure to install live-server globally as a dependancy or it will not work**

```bash
npm install -g live-server
```

## Modifying the project

You can then modify the `tailwind.config.js` for your own custom colors if needed
And modify the `index.html` inside the `src` directory.
